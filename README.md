# Personal infrastructure

This is a monorepo for my personal infrastructure.

I've been getting into IaC as a way to learn about cloud infrastructure, and make it easier to manage my personal infrastructure with life's chaos. Otherwise, I tend to leave resources running and accruing costs.

## IaC tools

I use **[Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/)** to manage my infrastructure. I chose Pulumi because it's a modern IaC tool that is extrememly flexible.
